Questions:

For the explanations, generally a sentence or two should be enough.
Type your answers directly in this file.


1.  Compile and run the solve.cpp program, using the makefile.
Watch the program solve a maze using DFS.  How many steps long was
the solution?

TODO:

2.  Edit solve.cpp to switch to the LinkedListStack.  Keep the same
maze.  How many steps long was the solution?

TODO:

3.  Edit solve.cpp to change the maze to Maze 2.  How many steps long
was the solution?

TODO:

4.  Edit solve.cpp to change the maze to Maze 3.  How many steps long
was the solution?

TODO:

5.  Edit solve.cpp to change the maze to Maze 4.  How many steps long
was the solution?

TODO:

6.  By looking at these examples, and by looking at the TextMaze.cpp class,
which direction does the TextMaze class try to explore first when doing DFS?

TODO:

7.  Next, edit solve.cpp again to switch to make activeStates
an UnsortedPriorityQueue.  This gives you best-first search (BestFS).
Repeat how many steps long is the solution for Mazes 1, 2, 3, and 4?
Do you see why DFS is called DFS, and BestFS isn't always best?

TODO:

8.  Edit solve.cpp to solve the empty Sudoku board.  (You should
only comment out one line and uncomment one line to do that.)
Then change the delay in the usleep delay in the solveMaze function
to 100000.  What solution do you get?

TODO:

9.  Edit solve.cpp to switch to the 3x3 slider puzzle.  (Be careful not
to use the unsolvable 3x3!)  Also, comment out the delay and print
statements in the solveMazefunction.  (Try it first with the delay and
print, so you can watch the solving process, but take them out for
timing.) How long (time in seconds) does it take to solve this problem
with BestFS (using UnsortedPriorityQueue as in the preceding question)?

TODO:

10.  Edit solve.cpp to switch back to ArrayStack or LinkedListStack,
which switches back to DFS.  Try solving the 3x3 slider puzzle.
What happens?  Why?
